# High-School-Projects-in-Cpp
Here are some projects I did in C++ when I was in high school (2015-2017). The codes are pretty laughable: monotlithic, lacking indentation at places, and using header files which came with Turbo C (That is the standard env. for teaching C and C++ in schools and colleges in India. I don't know why).   
I didn't know much about Git at that time so had to save files with different names. It was my own way of version control :-)
